You are a primary close contact of a person who has coronavirus (COVID-19) or you have been exposed to an exposure site where there has been the risk of transmission of COVID-19. An Authorised Officer has determined this under section 200 of the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 (Vic).<br />
You were exposed to COVID-19 on {{{Case.Day_0_Exposure_to_the_confirmed_case__c}}}. This date may change if your exposure is ongoing (for example, if you stay in the same accommodation as a confirmed case while they are unwell).<br />
There is a high chance that people who have been close to someone with COVID-19 will have the virus and can spread it to other people. The best way to protect yourself, your family and the community is to stay at home and stay away from other people.<br />
We recommend that you get tested now to see if you have COVID-19 - please see further information below and attached on where to get tested.<br />
