Thank you for helping to keep our community safe by staying in quarantine. <br />

Your quarantine period finishes at 11:59 PM on {!Case.Day14_Anticipated_last_day_of_quarantine__c}. This means from this time you can leave your home and return to normal activities.<br />

Please note this email is only about you {!Case.Account}. Other people in your household in isolation or quarantine must stay in isolation or quarantine until they are specifically told by an Authorised Officer that they can leave. <br />

If you have any questions, please call us at the Department of Health on <b>1300 651 160 </b>(press 0 for COVID-19, then once connected, and if required, please request an interpreter).<br />
<br />

Yours sincerely<br />
