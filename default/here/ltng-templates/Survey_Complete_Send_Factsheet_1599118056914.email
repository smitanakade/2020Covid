<span style="font-size:11px;">Dear {{{case.Account}}},</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Thank you for your time earlier today. As discussed, you have been notified as a confirmed case of coronavirus disease which means you have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. There is now a risk you could spread the virus to other people, including those you live with.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><meta /><span style="font-size:11px;"><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:</b></span></span></p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Read the confirmed case factsheet (link below) ‘Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) – confirmed case’ to ensure you meet the quarantine requirements.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Continue to isolate at home, away from <span style="color:#ff0000;">XX</span> as much as possible over the coming days.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The department will be in regular contact with you through either a text messaging service or phone calls.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Once your symptoms start resolving, we will work with you to determine when your isolation ends.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:11px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>HOW TO ISOLATE:</b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#2f5496;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Stay at home or in your hotel room or healthcare setting</span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Isolation (Diagnosis) Direction that is currently in effect makes it compulsory for anyone with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 to go into isolation for a minimum period, and to meet other compulsory conditions before being able to resume normal activities. Penalties apply to those who refuse or fail to comply with this direction.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Isolate yourself at home or in your accommodation until you are advised by a Public Health Officer that you can return to your usual activities. If you do not isolate yourself sufficiently from people you share a house with, they are more likely to catch coronavirus and will need to start 14 days of self-quarantine from the date they last had close contact with you while you were infectious.</span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><b><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You must not leave your house or accommodation except to seek medical attention or limited other permitted reasons, such as an emergency or if required by law.</span></span></b></li>
		<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You should stay in a different room to other people. Use a separate bathroom if available.</span></span></li>
		<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Wear a surgical face mask if you cannot avoid being in the same room as another person and when seeking medical care.</span></span></li>
		<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Do not go to work, school, university, work or attend public places or events. Do not use public transport or taxi services.</span></span></li>
		<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Get others such as friends or family, who are not required to be isolated, to get food or other necessities for you.</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you have difficulties getting food or necessities, call 1800 675 398 for support.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you need a translator first call 131 450, then request the hotline on 1800 675 398.

<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#2f5496;">Going outside</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you live in a private house, then it is safe for you to go outside into your garden, balcony or courtyard.<br />
If you live in an apartment it is also safe for you to go outside into the garden while wearing a surgical mask. You should, however, go quickly through any common areas on the way to the garden. Wear a surgical mask if you have to move through these areas.<br />
Make sure you keep a distance of 1.5 metres between yourself and any other people you encounter in common areas.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
